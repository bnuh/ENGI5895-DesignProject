# ENGI5895-DesignProject

The project proposed in an Android based social media viewer, which will simplify several of the user’s popular social media accounts into a simple swipe based randomized post viewer, similar to Tinder user interaction, with each post rated by the swipe mechanic (swipe left for negative, swipe right for positive). The swipe will increase or decrease the likelihood of a posters content from appearing in the user’s randomized viewable posts, with the list of posts to be viewed customizable according to date posted (the last day, two days, etc) and social media source.

This site will restrict the user to viewing only, instead of posting or replying, and will be a passive and simple interaction with the user. The UI will be a clean and simple card based display with content displayed on an animated deck of cards, presenting content such as image, text and video free of comments. Swiping will dismiss the card in a simple animation from a visual “deck” representing the number of posts in the user’s desired timeframe.

The project will interact with Twitter, Facebook and Instagram APIs to view the users followed posts, and store information based on the user's swipe activity locally.
